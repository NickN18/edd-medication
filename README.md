The purpose of this project is to have a stepper motor be able to be autonomously controlled in accordance
to whatever day of the week it is, as well a specified time of day. The servo will turn for a certain amount
of time, then stop. The servo WILL NOT move until the next time and date that is specified. As of right now (1/23/19),
there are no near-future plans to have a website where data could be entered to select a day and time, repeating if
necessary, for customization. If there is extra time, a website will be included using PHP, MySQL, and Javascript to send
data to the Arduino so that it can utilize user input for unique persons and their corresponding products.
